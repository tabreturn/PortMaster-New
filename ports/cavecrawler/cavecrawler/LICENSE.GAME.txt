Hellos,
This game is really awesome, I am currently working to port this game to retro arm linux-based handhelds via portmaster and I am wondering if you are okay with the distribution of the game via Portmaster, or would you prefer users to download the gamefiles from here directly?

Feel free to distribute the game however you like as long as it remains 100% free.

Awesome! Yes it will remain 100% free. Thank you for making a really fun game :)
May Portmaster distribute your other games too?
