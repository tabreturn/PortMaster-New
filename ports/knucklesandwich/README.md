## Notes

Thanks to Andy Brophy (https://andybrophy.itch.io) for creating this fantastic game, which you can purchase at https://store.steampowered.com/app/1012570/Knuckle_Sandwich

You'll need to purchase the game from https://store.steampowered.com/app/1012570/Knuckle\_Sandwich. You'll need a specific release, which you can obtain using a tool like DepotDownloader (https://github.com/SteamRE/DepotDownloader). There are also GUIs for DepotDownloader, like https://depotdownloader.00pium.net. The command may vary depending on your system, but the `-app`, `-depot`, and `-manifest` digits must match those below:

`./DepotDownloader -app 1012570 -depot 1012572 -manifest 5720277990085998436 -username <STEAM_USERNAME> -password <STEAM_PASSWORD>`

Once you've grabbed this, place the knucklesandwich.exe in the port's gamedata folder.
