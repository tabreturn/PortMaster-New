Hello Tristan!

Sure, I give you my permission. I even made an update to the game to allow keyboard navigation through all menus (except volume adjustment, but I guess this can be done on the handheld level?). And reduced input lag :)

Feel free to ask for a special build (ex. for linux or without volume slider to not confuse players).

Cheers!
Ivan

Hi, Ivan --

My name is Tristan, and I'm part of a group of developers working on porting games to handheld Linux devices. Our project is named PortMaster http://portmaster.games

Recently, we've started adding various Godot games to these systems and would love to include your game as well. We've observed various homebrew sites simply distributing files without permission. We firmly believe in contacting creators like you to ask for consent. Would you permit us to include your Fox Tower game files in our packages? Without your consent, users must otherwise manually download the files for our ports

We do not want to profit or take credit for your games. Our primary goal is to introduce more games to our beloved handheld devices, and we're also branching out to other ARM platforms.

Thank you for considering our request!
